   EveryDay Challenge
   
   This will contain all the various games , tools and experiments I take up and complete within a timeframe. This might be 1 to 3 or (n) days. The main focus of this are,
- Become better at C++ or programming in-general with some pratical projects.
- Explore low level and high level of making a game more specifically but also other applications/tools. (structring , memeory managements , graphics , physics , game engines archiectures , etc to maybe ML too )
- Doing thing from Scratch i.e no engines. 
The last point is a bit tricky , as I said no engines , I will initially try to use frameworks  avaiable for rendering and other stuff libraries .
until I am become proficient maybe at a point I make my OWN computer level.

As of now (last updated - 19-05-2024)  <----- I AM HERE 

I plan to initial make exisitng games either by following tutorials  to  replicate their steps or just try to remake an existing games. This will help me to drill down
the pratically challenges I might face beyond the knowing the syntaxes of C++. 

-I am using RAYLIB for most of the project. All the things created using it will be under RayLibBranch.
And all the things created will be under bracnhes named RL_NAME_OF_PROJECT 


**Note: Though I was using SFML initally (i do love it still) , but for some reason RAYLIB clicked more for me. So i will be using it.**
